""" *** Experimental 1D heat conduction model ****

Calculates heat conduction and the amount of superimposed ice (SI) that forms, intended for use in snow and ice.

- Only conduction is modelled.
- While refreezing is simulated, there is no melt simulation. During the model run, no water (as slush or
irreducible water content) is added. All water is present from the start of the model run.
- It is assumed that there is infinite amount of slush available for refreezing.
- The irreducible water content is being specified as input parameter
- SI formation can be simulated both at the top or at the bottom of the domain.
    - SI formation at the top to investigate how much SI forms when slush is sitting on top of a cold ice slab and
    heat flux is from the slush into the cold ice slab.
    - SI simulation at the bottom when a snow cover is partially filled with slush and heat flow is from the slush.
    through the snow and towards the snow surface (where heat is lost to a cold atmosphere).
- The model can take irreducible water content inside the snowpack into account. It does so by assuming that each
  layer's irreducible water first needs to be frozen before heat conduction through that layer is possible. This means
  any presence of irreducible water strongly slows the progression of a cold wave.
- Boundary conditions:
    - Top and bottom boundary conditions can be defined. Bottom boundary condition can be left open.
    - Boundary conditions can be a constant temperature, sine curve of air temperature variations,
